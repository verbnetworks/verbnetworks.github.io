title: Terraform + Digital Ocean + Syncthing Relay Server
---

v0.2.0 of the Terraform + Digital Ocean + Syncthing Relay Server has been released.  This release saw many improvements
and enhancements over the previous v0.1.x series mainly due to the native support of the underlying Ubuntu apt-package 
to run as a service which meant much a good chunk of setup code could be discarded.

A good amount of documentation updates, a notable bug fix and some improved variable naming.
