Projects come, and some projects go.  Here are some older projects looking for a new lease of life
with expressions of interest from people like you.


## Time Stamp Verify
Time Stamp Verify, Time Stamp Notary and Time Lapse Verify are a suite of three services to provide 
signed timestamps for digital objects.  At the core of the service is a system that regularly creates
a message with a block of recently requested data-object sha256-digests, appends this with the 
sha256-digest of the previous, then signs the resulting output and passes it as an attachment through
a rotating list of third-party, well-established email providers.  Because modern email providers all 
sign and system-timestamp these messages via DKIM it becomes possible for third-parties to independently 
verify timestamps and their associated hash-chains.

This project could take two equally interesting paths, (a) simply re-tool to make use of a modern 
block-chain framework (eg Ethereum) to facilitate signing mechanism or (b) continue the service to provide
the service as-is and develop integration end-points for common block-chain systems to provide independent 
time certification.  If you have an interest in Time Stamp get in contact to discuss.

## Search Burn
Search Burn started life as a simple PHP library to interface programmatically with Google Alerts and
evolved into a full-blown API driven service.  As the Google Alerts service itself evolved the 
results from it have become less accurate, timely or useful which has impacted Search Burn and the 
results available.
  
This project needs to be re-tooled to take a data-poll/data-pull approach rather than the 
callback-listen/data-push approach that it was conveniently able to rely on.  If you have an 
interest in Search Burn get in contact to discuss.

## Asset Geo Manage
Asset Geo Manage is yet-another system for managing GPS tracking devices typically mounted on vehicles or
other mobile equipment.  These systems are plentiful however few of them deal with the requirements of
larger operators needing to manage projects, fleets, locations, user-logins, user-permissions and alerts.

This project needs a commercial sponsor to bring it back to life. If you have an interest in Asset Geo Manage
get in contact to discuss.
